My opinion on blogging to paraphrase Winston Churchill - *“Never have so many, written so much, read by so few.”*

## So why on Earth have I started a blog?

I make a lot of notes and often find myself referring back to these including programming commands etc. I figured I will store them here & open-source them. This is for three main purposes:

1) To help me organise my thoughts and retain the things I learn
2) A central place to store & refer back to notes
3) For other people to use on the small chance that they may be useful for others

## Who am I?

I am a bioinformatician and PhD student at the University of Cambridge

## What will I write about

I hope to start blogging more frequently about (my) research and PhD-related things to document stuff that I learn. I'll likely cover topics such as:
- Biology
    - Immunology
    - Vaccines
    - Viruses
- Computing
    - Bioinformatics
    - Data Science
    - Machine learning
- Maths
    - Statistics
    - Probability theory
    - Linear algebra

As time goes on I may expand to cover other interests. These may include [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), tech (start-ups), personal development, productivity, life learnings, reading, travel, health and relationships.

## Thank you
I don't really anticipate anyone else reading this blog so I'm flattered if you are :slightly_smiling_face:

If you’re interested in any of the topics above then you’re in the right place. I will generally try and keep my posts short, fun & practical. I would love any feedback you might have so please don’t hesitate to [reach out](../../#contact).

Thanks for reading!
