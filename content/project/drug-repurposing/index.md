Found drug targets and pathways to accelerate the pharma industry, demoing the results for a pilot with AstraZeneca.

This was for a project for the [AI Engine](https://lifebit.ai/intelligent-cloud). I built:
1. An [RShiny application](https://philpalmer.shinyapps.io/drug_repurposing/) to visaulise the results of the drug targets
2. A [bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/lifebit-ai/pathway-analysis) in Nextflow to automate the discovery of enriched pathways
