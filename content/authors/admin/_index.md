Phil Palmer is a PhD student in biology at the University of Cambridge, in [Professor Jonathan Heeney](https://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/jlh66@cam.ac.uk)'s lab. His research interests include bioinformatics, machine learning and viral genomics. He is currently working on computational methods to design broad-spectrum vaccines and antibodies against pathogens such as coronaviruses and influenza viruses.

Prior to this he worked for two years as an early employee and bioinformatician at the breakout start-up [Lifebit](https://lifebit.ai/). He also holds a first-class degree in Biology from the University of Southampton.
