summary: Winner of the world's first clean meat hackathon
abstract: "I was fortunate enough to participate in the world's first Cellular Agriculture Hackathon at Imperial College Advanced Hackspace! The competition was organised by HigherSteaks. After a very exciting and inspiring two days, our team's start-up 're-medAI' pitched our novel solution for how machine learning could be used to recycle nutrient media and we won the competition!"
